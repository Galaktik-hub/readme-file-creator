This program lets you create freely a README file for your GitHub profile or your projects.

Throught a graphical interface, you can type in your text and the way you want to formate it.

Once you're done creating your README file, you can type the 'Finished!' button and it will create the file in your current directory.

In the footer of the README, there will always be a credit to this program, I do not restreint you to remove it, thought crediting someone for their work is always good!
